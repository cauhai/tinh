This folder is for Android's app links. It contains a JSON file to mean "the Android app with ID com.tinh" is REALLY owned by me

This is for Android link, a link on a mobile device should go to the app with said ID.

To deploy:
- push code 	https://github.com/cauhai/tinh.git
- Netlify will build and deploy it at https://tinhtinhtinh.netlify.app
